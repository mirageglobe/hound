Hound is a cli tool that is based off clamav and chrootkit.

There is also several handy cron example scripts for setting up clamav. infact it almost always runs out of memory. This project aims to simply use progressive incremental techniques of marking and isolation of files to scan a system. Ideally this deals with both micro vms or docker containers.

Hound is a commandline application that does the following :

- provides a single maintained scan of one location
- a strategic sweep of systemwide files and folders
- a strategic incremental scan for memory limited machines or instances (less than 512mb)

Use cases :

- as a commandline tool for scanning
- as a prehook vulnerability scanner for git
